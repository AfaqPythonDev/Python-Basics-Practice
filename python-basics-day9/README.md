# Python Basics – Day 9 (Object-Oriented Programming – Basics)

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains my **Day 9 Python practice work**, focused on learning the **basics of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python.  
The goal of this day was to understand how classes and objects are used to structure programs in a clean and reusable way.


## 📚 Topics Covered
- Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming  
- Classes and Objects  
- `__init__()` constructor  
- Instance variables  
- Methods in a class  

## 📝 Tasks Completed

### 1️⃣ Student Class
- Created a `Student` class  
- Attributes:
  - name  
  - age  
- Method:
  - `display_info()` to print student details  
- Created an object and called the method  


### 2️⃣ Calculator Class
- Created a `Calculator` class  
- Attributes:
  - num1  
  - num2  
- Methods:
  - `add()` to print sum  
  - `subtract()` to print difference  
- Created an object and called both methods  

### 3️⃣ Car Class
- Created a `Car` class  
- Attributes:
  - brand  
  - model  
- Method:
  - `show_details()` to print car information  
- Created an object and displayed details
