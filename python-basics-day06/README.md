# Python Basics – Day 6 (Loops)

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains my **Day 6 Python practice work**, focused on learning **loops** in Python.  
The objective of this day was to understand how to repeat tasks efficiently using `for` and `while` loops.


## 📚 Topics Covered
- for loop  
- while loop  
- range() function  
- Iterating over strings and numbers  


## 📝 Tasks Completed

### 1️⃣ Print Numbers from 1 to 10
- Used a `for` loop  
- Printed numbers from 1 to 10  


### 2️⃣ Sum of First N Numbers
- Took a number `n` as input  
- Used a `while` loop  
- Calculated and printed the sum from 1 to `n`  

### 3️⃣ Multiplication Table
- Took a number as input  
- Printed its multiplication table from 1 to 10 using a loop  


### 4️⃣ Count Characters in a String
- Took a string as input  
- Used a loop to count the number of characters  
- Printed the total character count
