# Python Basics – Day 12 (Advanced Python 1)

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains my **Day 12 Python practice work**, focused on learning **advanced Python concepts** such as list comprehension, dictionary comprehension, and simple lambda functions. The goal of this day was to understand more Pythonic ways to write clean and efficient code.


## 📚 Topics Covered
- List Comprehension
- Dictionary Comprehension
- Lambda Functions (beginner-level)


## 📝 Tasks Completed

### 1️⃣ List Comprehension
- Created a list of numbers from 1 to 20
- Created a new list of squares using list comprehension
- Printed both lists

### 2️⃣ Dictionary Comprehension
- Created a dictionary where keys = numbers 1–5
- Values = cubes of numbers
- Printed the dictionary

### 3️⃣ Lambda Functions (Simple)
- Created a lambda function to add two numbers
- Called the lambda function and printed the result
