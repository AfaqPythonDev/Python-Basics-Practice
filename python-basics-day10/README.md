# Python Basics – Day 10 (Inheritance & OOP Part 2)

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains my **Day 10 Python practice work**, focused on learning **inheritance and advanced Object-Oriented Programming concepts** in Python.  
The goal of this day was to understand how classes can reuse code through parent–child relationships.


## 📚 Topics Covered
- Inheritance in Python  
- Parent and child classes  
- Method overriding  
- Using `super()`  
- Code reusability with OOP  


## 📝 Tasks Completed

### 1️⃣ Person → Student
- Created a `Person` class with:
  - name  
  - age  
- Created a `Student` class that inherits from `Person` with:
  - roll_number  
- Displayed all details using a method  


### 2️⃣ Vehicle → Car
- Created a `Vehicle` class with:
  - brand  
- Created a `Car` class that inherits from `Vehicle` with:
  - model  
- Displayed vehicle information using a method  


### 3️⃣ Animal → Dog
- Created an `Animal` class with:
  - name  
- Created a `Dog` class that inherits from `Animal`  
- Overrode a method to display a sound
